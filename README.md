# aquila-app

An iOS app version of Aquila, an untethered jailbreak for iOS 6

This app provides an alternative installation method for Aquila, particularly useful for users on platforms where Aquila is not available, like Linux. With this, users can now sideload the app and jailbreak directly from their device.

## Usage

Download and sideload the IPA from the [latest release](https://github.com/LukeZGD/aquila-app/releases/latest) using [Sideloadly](https://sideloadly.io/).

On Linux, use [Legacy iOS Kit](https://github.com/LukeZGD/Legacy-iOS-Kit) to sideload the IPA.

## Jailbreaking

- The jailbreak process starts immediately when the app is launched.
- If successful, the device will reboot and Cydia should appear on the home screen.

## Notes

- If the app crashes, the exploit may have failed. Simply try launching it again.
- The app is only for unjailbroken devices. On devices that are already jailbroken, the app will only crash immediately.

## Supported Devices

All devices that support iOS 6

## Building

This project is built using Xcode 13.4.1 and macOS Monterey 12.6.
